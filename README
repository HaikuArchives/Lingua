1. About

Lingua is a multiple language translation utility. It translates words to and from English into several languages, including Latin, German, Dutch, Italian, French, Spanish, Indonesian, and Portuguese. It can only do simple word and phrase translations, not entire sentences or paragraphs, but is still very useful for those times when you forget how to say "love" in Latin (it's "amare").

Lingua originally used the dictionary text files supplied by GPLTrans. I've taken it upon myself to clean up the dictionary files and have plans to expand them (see 3. How To Help below). These dictionary files are part of an open project, and thus, are missing many words, both esoteric and mundane, e.g. there is currently no definition for "troutslap" in Portuguese. 

Questions, comments, and bug reports can be submitted to dream@aevum.net with some mention of Lingua in the subject line. Any comments or complaints about the dictionary files themselves (e.g. "Why can't I find the definition for foobar in Spanish?") should not be submitted, but will be handled separately.

2. Installation and Usage

If you're reading this, you've already unzipped the Lingua zipfile. You can put the Lingua folder anywhere you want. The only installation requirement is that the "dicts" folder, containing all the dictionary textfiles, must be in the same directory as the Lingua binary. The "docs" folder should also be in the same directory. 

Using Lingua should be very straightforward. Once the application is opened, you simply enter a word into the text box, pick which language you want to translate to or from, and hit the "Translate" button. Results will appear in the large white text area beneath the controls. The title tab reports the current progress or number of results. 

See the documentation for more specific information. 

3. How To Help

There are two aspects to Lingua: the program, and the dictionary files. The program is my responsibility, but keeping the dictionary files accurate and up to date is more work than I alone can handle. 

If you're interested in donating some time and effort towards cleaning up and expanding the dictionary files, contact me at dream@aevum.net with your name and what languages you'd like to help with. Also, visit www.aevum.net/lingua/project.html for more details on the project and its current progress.

Because Lingua isn't my entire life, I won't expect your contributions to be your entire life either. All I'm asking for is several hours of time to make this program more useful to you, as well as everyone else. I'll do what I can myself, but the more help I get, the better.
